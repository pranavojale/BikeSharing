# Project Name
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
1) Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2) How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
	A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
	They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- What is the background of your project?
	We have taken data of BoomBikes number of usage and possible factors affecting them.
	We have created Linear Regression model to find out factors affecting demand of bikes.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
	We are trying to find out factors affecting bikes demand.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
	Data of BoomBikes number of usage and possible factors affecting them.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Please find analysis of Liner Regression model below -
- Temperature is most affecting factor to demand of bikes. As temperature increases bike demand increases.
- Light Rain weather is slightly reducing demands for bikes.
- Year has also affected demands for bike
